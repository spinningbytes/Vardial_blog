We reproduce here the results from http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~smalmasi/vardial5/pdf/W18-3925.pdf
The competition consisted on discriminating between four major labels which roughly could be assigned to four different cantons. Each canton stand for a different dialect ("BE,"BS","LU","ZH").

Our system rank second together with several others, but in this group we also high, achieving the total second position of the competition (second rank were not significantly distinguible).
